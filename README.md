# Elements

## Summary
__Elements__ is an RPG turn-based game that centers on the four elements (Water, Earth, Fire and Air) and how they are used together or against each other in dynamic gameplay.

## Gameplay and Features
Users will create a hero with a chosen element that determines their attacks and weapons. Each level has an element theme, and opponents of the level wield the element of that level. Elements will have a weakness to one other element, which will affect player damage. Complete with 10 levels, heroes will have to battle their way to the end to earn the title _King of Elements_.

## Getting started
Elements is run on Python 3, so you will need to have that installed.

To install Python 3, [click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once installed, you can [download](https://github.com/alexrogers823/Elements/archive/master.zip) Elements manually, or inputting `git clone git@github.com:alexrogers823/Elements.git` into your terminal.

## What I learned
After writing a lot of scripted and functional programs, I wanted to get better at Python by using Object-Oriented Programming in my code. When watching Python tutorials in Treehouse that had a similar RPG layout, the "Elements" idea spawned in my head and I began planning.

#### Challenges and Solutions
- Early on, I had a challenge understanding getters and setters in classes, and when they were necessary in the code. I solved this by referring back to my blueprint of what variables were going to change during gameplay.
- Another challenge was deciding what would be in the main program and what needed to be imported as a separate file. This helped me to learn more about abstraction.
- Getting the save feature to work by a user-inputted password was challenging.

#### Improvements/Additional Features
- Diversify character names and attacks
- Refactored code to have one central "level" function
- Added tutorial class variable to show tips as user progresses through gameplay

Thank you to those who have starred, forked and tested my code!
